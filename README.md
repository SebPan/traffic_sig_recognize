# traffic_sign_recognize
Python scripts for making traffic sign recognizing to be implemented in a Raspberry Pi. 
In the classes folder, there are 4000 images, a thousand per class. In this case, we have four classes, stop, right, left and background.
In the files folder, we can find the neural network files and the data set files.
