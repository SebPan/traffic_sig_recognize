# traffic_sig_recognize
Python scripts for making traffic sign recognizing to be implemented in a Raspberry Pi. In the classes folder, there are 4000 images, a thousand per class. In this case, we have four classes, stop, right, left and background. In the files folder, we can find the neural network files and the data set files. In the environment directory, we have the conda environment to install with the libraries used in this project. Finally we have four Python scripts to be used for making the data set, setting it up, make the learning process and the recognize code.
